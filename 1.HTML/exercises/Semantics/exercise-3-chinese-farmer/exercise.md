- Translate the html page into semantic html, using the right html tags : `h1`, `h2`, `blockquote`, `q`, `img`, `img`, `hr`, `figure` and `caption`, `table`, `th`, `tr`, `td`, `ul` or `ol` and`li`.

- No `div` or `span`: they do not provide any semantics.

- Find, for each of these tags, the origin of their name (that's how we remember them). If in doubt, look for the answer on the documentation.

- Add two or three links of your choice in the html page via the tag `a`.

- Is there a part that could be considered as a header? If so, group it in a `header` tag.

- And a footer? If so, group this content together in a `footer` tag

- Put all instances of the words "Maybe" in a `em` or `strong` tag.

- Add the attribute `Alt` to the images. What is the purpose of this attribute?

- Add a "*good*" or "*bad*" class to the tags surrounding the words "Good" and "Bad".

- Find the link attribute to indicate the page to which the link should lead, and add it.

- Make sure that when you click on the links, the page opens in a new browser tab.

- Find the attribute to display a small text box when hovering over links, like this:

We will cover that on our next chapter: **CSS**.
