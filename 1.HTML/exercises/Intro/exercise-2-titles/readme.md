# Exercise 2 - Titles

Time to start exploring more html elements. Look at the index.html file and the result in the browser. There should be nothing displayed. Add a `<h1>` element with the text 'title from an h1 tag' and look at the result. There is also an `<h2>` element, repeat the same process for this tag as well. Continue doing this for all `<h#>` elements.
