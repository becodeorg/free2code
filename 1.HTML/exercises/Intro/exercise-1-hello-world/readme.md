# exercise 1 - Hello world

Take a look at the index.html file. At the moment the file is empty. Add all the necessary tags for the base layout of an html document: a doctype, an `<html>` element and a `<head>` and `<body>` element. Be careful though, you can't just place these elements wherever you like. They have a function and should be placed in a specific order.
Read the documentation if you're not sure how to use these html elements.

Finally add a `<p>` element with the text 'hello world' to your document. The text should be displayed in the browser.
